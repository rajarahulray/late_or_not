# late_or_not
A simple classification program using k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to predict if I am going to be late or not for office based on the following parameters:

1. day 	(Day number 1 for Monday and 7 for Sunday)
2. temp. (temprature of respective day)	
3. w_time (wakeup_time)
4. l_time (leave_time)
5. m_reach_time_ 	(time to reach metro station)
6. m_delay_time 	(Metro waiting time)
7. m_arrival_time 	(arrival time of Metro)
8. m_deboard_time 	(Metro deborading time)
9. o_reach_time 	(time of arrival at office)
7. late (Binary values 0 for not late 1 for late)

__Note__: Time values are taken as per military time standards.
